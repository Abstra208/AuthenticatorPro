Authenticator Pro generates Two Factor Authentication (2FA) codes for your online accounts. TOTP, HOTP, mOTP (Mobile-OTP) and Steam are supported. The generated codes are one time tokens that provide an extra layer of security to your online accounts. After scanning a simple QR code, your account is protected.
